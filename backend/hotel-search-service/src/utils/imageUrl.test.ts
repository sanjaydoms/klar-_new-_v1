/**
 * Guardrails for supplier image resolution.
 *
 * These exist because a hotel detail page advertised "19 Photos" and rendered
 * nineteen broken tiles. The frontend inferred the CDN from the file extension,
 * so every relative TripJack path was rewritten to the Hotelbeds CDN, which had
 * never hosted it. The invariant below is what stops that returning: a
 * reference we cannot resolve yields "" and is dropped, never guessed into a
 * URL that will 404.
 *
 * Run: npm test
